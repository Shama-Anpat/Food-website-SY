        The Rollz is mainly aimed at providing easy-to-eat food at a really
        affordable price so that “what to eat?” is not the prime question for
        the youth and the late working force. Of course you may have a
        little problem choosing what to eat due to the vast customization
        we offer. You can spend time to create a legendary roll for
        yourselves or just choose the pre-made options we have carefully
        selected. 				
        We can deliver the food to you in any corner as long as you
        are in the city of Mumbai. Our services are open 24\7 because
        hunger does not have a fixed time. Be it a party of 100 or just a
        night out before an exam, no order too big no order too small.
         The Rollz is always on the roll for you</about>
